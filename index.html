        This is a message-box that is hidden until a user clicks a any of the three display buttons at the top. Once any of this three buttons are clicked, this message box you are currently reading pops up. You can close the message box by clicking the cancle button in the message box or by clicking the blurred area or the "esc" key on your keyboard. why would I need three buttons to display the same message you may ask, it is just for the purpose of practicing how to apply same function to elements with same class name by selecting the class name with querySelectorAll and looping through it before applying the aforementioned function.
